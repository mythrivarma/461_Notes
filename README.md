##Chapter 1##
* Here is the logical query processing order of the six main query clauses:
 * FROM
 * WHERE
 * GROUP BY
 * HAVING
 * SELECT
 * ORDER BY

* Date Time Columns can be queried like this:
WHERE hiredate >= '20030101'
* ORDER BY clause is the first and only clause that is allowed to refer to column
aliases defined in the SELECT clause. Thatâ€™s because the ORDER BY clause is the only one
to be evaluated after the SELECT clause

#In a Nutshell#

##SQL History and Implementations##
* In the early 1970s, the seminal work of IBM research fellow Dr. E. F. Codd led to the development of a relational data model product called SEQUEL, or Structured English Query Language. SEQUEL ultimately became SQL, or Structured Query Language.
* Although IBM was the first to develop relational database theory, Oracle was first to market the technology. Over time, SQL proved popular enough in the marketplace to attract the attention of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), which released standards for SQL in 1986, 1989, 1992, 1999, 2003, and 2006 and recently 2011. This text covers the ANSI 2003 standard because the 2006 standard deals with elements of SQL outside the scope of the commands described in this book. (In essence, the SQL2006 standard describes how XML would be used in SQL.)

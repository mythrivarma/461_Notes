* Responsibilities of SCM -> Docuemntation, Restrospective Meeting, Causal Analysis, COde Management.
* pareto chart, Process chart, scatter chart, Fish bone diagram.
* Where to change the stautus in quality center (details/Description etc).
* defect leakage, defect prevention, defect Management, Defect prediction.
* which of the following come under functional Testing- 1) checking application loads 2) If user is able to log in 3) if error is thrown when wrong user is logging 4) if 10 users can login in parallel.
* some chart (with Bar graph and accumulated percentages) and something like to show 80% of something. 
* Regression Testing - What to do if time is very less : get more time / resources? proceed by prioritizing the testcases? do random test cases? 
* What should be considered to analyze defect leakage from previous phase (Current phase in end of System Testing) - a) only Unit Testing defects b) all System Testing defects c) UAT defects.
* where should we update a snapshot in quality center : Details, Description, Attachements? 
* Age = 200 what should this he considered. Illogical? invalid? Negative test case since it opens up other faulty scenarios?
* After raising the defect to dev, he said that the code is correct but the test data is wrong so what should we update status in QC- Re-test? Reject? Re-open? 
* what is the equivalent classes (actual requirement is a text box which accepts 3-15 characters, alphanumeric, first two are letters) options a) less than 3 characters, Alphanumeric, First two are not letters b)same as requirement c) just like option a but negation on 2nd requirement instead of 1 and 3.
* Client told that May release (both Major and Minor) dint go well and he is not happy with the quality. so what should we consider while analyising the cause (select multiple) a. complexity  b. Categorize defects c. high level and low level requirements d. dont remember
* in Audit the auditor asked to show our progress on improving defect effeciency so what should we show? a) some defect trend chart of past 8 months b) defect trend of previous quarter c) Defect Density chart d) no of defects in previous and current month.

#Web Search, blogs and forums#
* RSiteSearch() - uses search engine at search.r-project.org
* RSiteSearch("arithematic mean") and RSiteSearch("{arithematic mean}") -- see the difference. 
* sos package can be installed from web and loaded to the library. the findFn() funtion in the sos package will work in the same way as RSiteSearch() but it is more appleaing to the eyes and also have some additional functionality. To install sos package, install.packages("sos") and then library("sos").
* If we want to search in web Search engines, using [R] will be more relevant.

#Unix Shell Scripting#

* Unix BASH Shell is used in Linux. BASH = Born Again SHell
* Putty is used to connect to Unix
* pwd- Present Working Directory
* ls- list of all the files in the pwd (the d-rwx-rrw- etc in ls output is first thing is Directory/file/socket/pipe etc. Next three is read/Write/Execute? for File Owner. Next three for User who are in the same group as file Owner and next three are for others ). Next there is a Number which shows how many links the file has. Next there is the User who is the Owner of the file. Next there is the Group to which the User belongs. Next there is the size of the file (Number of characters in the file). Next there is the timestamp when the file is last modified.Next is the file Name
* ls -l : long listing option
* Unix will Assign Different Terminal ID to different Users
* man : command to show manual example man ls gives the manual data for ls command.
* ls -l wel* : will show all files which start with 'wel'
* Check what ln (link) will do. also check what symbolic link is.
* cat : will show the contents of the file
* mkdir : to create a directory
* cd : to change directory 
* Lots of ways to create a file. In unix extenstions are useless. We just give it only for our understanding. 'vi' is oneway to create a file
* chmod : to change mode (permissions) to a file. chmod 700 means for owner its rwx and others its - . r=4, w=2, x=1. chown command to change the owner?
* variables are declared with out $ but must be called with a $.
* Executing a file with a dot (.) and with out a dot operator. Check the difference.
* Even though your command line is in BASH Shell, you can execute in a different shell like KSH (Korn SHell) by using some command (check the command).
* grep is for searching.
